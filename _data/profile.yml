    My name is Jiahao Zhou. I'm currently a Master's student at <a href="https://www.ssafs.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Safety Science</a>, Tsinghua University (THU) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wf/" target="_blank">Fei Wang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interest lies in Intelligent forest fire monitoring and disaster situational awareness. I received my B.E. degree from the <a href="https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering</a>, Wuhan University (WHU). In my undergraduate years, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/mengqingxiang/zh_CN/index.htm" target="_blank">Qingxiang Meng</a>, I founded AntiE Team to develop emergency monitoring technologies derivation via remote sensing techniques. Meanwhile, I enjoyed a great time conducting research on 3D point cloud processing under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://dongzhenwhu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhen Dong</a>, exploring multi-task learning in synthetic environments.
